# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic Snake game built using Python Turtle Graphics. The snake moves smoothly across the screen, grows when it eats food, and the game ends on collision with walls or itself.

## ✨ Technologies

- `Python`
- `Turtle Graphics`
- `Time`

## 🚀 Features

- Smooth snake movement with keyboard controls
- Food spawning at random locations
- Score tracking and game-over state
- Boundary detection and self-collision detection
- Clean, dark-themed UI

## 📍 The Process

This project was developed across **Day 20 and Day 21 of the 100 Days of Python Code** course.  
Day 20 focused on understanding how snake movement works by updating body segments in reverse order using the `range` function and tracking positions with x and y coordinates. Each segment follows the one ahead of it, while the head moves independently.

On Day 21, everything was tied together by organizing the logic into multiple classes. This helped reinforce concepts like constructors (`__init__`), class inheritance, and slicing lists and tuples to manage the snake’s body and collisions more cleanly.

## 🚦 Running the Project

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run the main file: `python main.py`  
3. Control the snake using arrow keys or WASD  
4. Click anywhere to exit after game over
